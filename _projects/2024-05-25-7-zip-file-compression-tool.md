## What is 7-Zip?

7-Zip is a file compression program developed by Igor Pavlov. It allows users to compress and decompress files into various formats, making it easier to store and share data. The software is available for Windows, with ports for other operating systems such as Linux and macOS.

## Key Features of 7-Zip

### Strong Encryption

For secure file compression, 7-Zip offers AES-256 encryption in the 7z and ZIP formats. This high level of encryption ensures that your compressed files are protected against unauthorized access.

### Open Source and Free

As an open-source tool, 7-Zip is free to use and modify. This transparency allows for community contributions and ensures that the software remains up-to-date with the latest compression technologies and security standards.

## How to Use 7-Zip

Using 7-Zip is straightforward. After downloading and installing the program, users can right-click on files or folders and select 7-Zip options from the context menu to compress or decompress them. The user-friendly interface also provides a file manager for more advanced operations.
