Deno is a modern, secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, created by Ryan Dahl, the original developer of Node.js. It aims to address Node.js's limitations while introducing new features.

## Key Features

### Security First

Deno runs scripts with restricted permissions by default, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access to the network, file system, or environment.

### TypeScript Support

Deno has built-in TypeScript support, allowing you to write and run TypeScript code without additional configuration.

### Standard Modules

Deno includes standard modules maintained by the core team, providing essential functionalities like file operations and HTTP servers.

### Modern JavaScript

Deno supports ES Modules, async/await, and the latest ECMAScript features, ensuring your code stays up-to-date.

## Benefits

### Simplicity

Deno provides a single executable that includes a dependency inspector, code formatter, and linter, simplifying the development process.

### Enhanced Security

Deno's explicit permission model ensures scripts only access resources they are allowed to, reducing security risks.

### Web Standards

Deno is compatible with web standards, making it easier to write code that works both in the browser and on the server.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Deno with a single command:

For Windows:
```sh
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

For macOS and Linux:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

### Running a Script

Create a simple script:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, Deno!");
```
Run it with:
```sh
deno run hello.ts
```

### Managing Permissions

Grant specific permissions using flags:
```sh
deno run --allow-net script.ts
```
