1.1.1.1 is a public DNS resolver service provided by Cloudflare, in partnership with APNIC. The purpose of this service is to offer a fast and privacy-focused DNS resolution service to users around the world.

### What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is essentially the phonebook of the internet. When you enter a domain name like example.com in your browser, DNS translates that domain name into an IP address that computers use to communicate with each other.

### Why Use 1.1.1.1?
1.1.1.1 is designed to provide several key benefits:

**Speed**: Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 service is one of the fastest DNS resolvers available. This means it can quickly translate domain names to IP addresses, potentially speeding up your internet browsing experience.

**Privacy**: Unlike many DNS resolvers, Cloudflare does not sell users' data to advertisers. They also have strict privacy policies and regularly conduct third-party audits to ensure they are following their privacy commitments.

**Security**: The service supports DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT), which encrypt DNS queries to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
